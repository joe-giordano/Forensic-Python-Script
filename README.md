Forensic-Python-Script
======================

Forensic Analysis Python Script. Will accept any disk image and analyze it accordingly. This is a project I had done for school over the summer. The script will determine whether the disk is a full disk image or a single partition and the user will be prompted with forensic analysis options such as printing a listing of all files (deleted or not), displaying the disk's MD5 sum, determining the file system type, and giving the total number of files and directories on disk
