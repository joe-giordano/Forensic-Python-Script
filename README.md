Forensic-Python-Script
======================

Forensic Analysis Python Script. Will accept any disk image and analyze it accordingly. This is a project I had done for school over the summer. The script will determine whether the disk is a full disk image or a single partition and the user will be prompted with forensic analysis options such as printing a listing of all files (deleted or not), displaying the disk's MD5 sum, determining the file system type, and giving the total number of files and directories on disk


The script relies on The Sleuth Kit (TSK) forensic suite and was run and tested on a system with TSK already installed
